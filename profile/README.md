Welcome to the Pulumiverse. This a place for the Pulumi community to interact and collaborate on Pulumi-based 
libraries, projects, and learning resources. The idea was initiated by a [Reddit comment][reddit-comment].

## Want to join the discussion?

Create an [issue](https://github.com/pulumiverse/.github/issues), introduce what you want to bring to the 
Pulumiverse community â€“ and off you go! 
You can reach us on the `#pulumiverse` channel of the [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/).

## Motivation

There are many libraries or collections of components for Pulumi out there. Most of them are made based on 
requirements of individual companies and developers. Pulumiverse aims to make a community where these 
libraries can be created, where opinionated configurations for Pulumi resources can be stored and discussed.

## Community setup

We defined the way of working for this community in the 
[Articles of Association](https://github.com/pulumiverse/.github/blob/main/governance/articles-of-association.md). 
Every year, we re-elect a new governance board, but at all times, you can see 
[who these board members are](https://github.com/pulumiverse/.github/blob/main/governance/board.md). 
This document is kept up to date after every election.

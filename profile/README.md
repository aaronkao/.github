Welcome to the Pulumiverse. This a place for the Pulumi community to interact and collaborate on Pulumi-based libraries, projects, and learning resources. The idea was initiated by a [Reddit comment][reddit-comment].

## Want to join the discussion?

Create an issue, introduce what you want to bring to the Pulumiverse community â€“ and off you go!

## Motivation

There are many libraries or collections of components for Pulumi out there. Most of them are made based on requirements of individual companies and developers. Pulumiverse aims to make a community where these libraries can be created, where opinionated configurations for Pulumi resources can be stored and discussed.

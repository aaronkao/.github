# Pulumi Community

This repository, named `.github`, is the repository containing the community documentation like:

* Code of Conduct
* Contributing Guidelines
* Governance Model
* Standard Github Issue Template(s)

It has the strange name `.github` because, for Github, it offers the option of centrally managing the community
guidelines, while they show up in the Github Web UI of every repository.

You can read all about the abilities of this repo in the 
[Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
